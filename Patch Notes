-- Balancing --
        - Added a system that will scale Enemy Stats based on their Species and their Ranking.
        - Eidarach and his minion AoEs will now do damage slightly earlier before they disappear.
        - Eidarach Minion AoE size has been reduced 30%, this is will balance them a little better and help
          the player differentiate between Eidarach and his minions.
        - Ivy Attack Speed increased from 2 to 2.5, this is also reflected in her Ultimate. Her Ultimate
          Attack Speed has been changed from 4 Attack Speed to 5 Attack Speed

-- Fixed --
        - Enemy Slowed status effect set to wrong timer
        - HP Regeneration causing HP to not equal Max HP (if Max HP is 80 then usually 80.03, or 79.98)
