# Call of the Void - Modding Guidelines

We’re excited for players to create mods for *Call of the Void*! Here are the rules and guidelines you must follow when modding the game:

## What You Can Do:
- You may modify the game’s code, assets, and any other content **for personal, non-commercial use**.
- You may share your mods freely with others, as long as they **do not** involve selling or redistributing modified versions of the game’s code or assets.
- You can create and distribute **mods** that alter gameplay, create new features, or adjust existing ones, as long as it doesn’t violate the other rules below.

## What You Cannot Do:
- **Commercial Use**: You cannot sell, rent, or distribute modified versions of the game or its assets for a profit.
- **No Derivatives for Distribution**: You cannot redistribute modified game assets or code. If you create a mod using the assets, you cannot distribute the original assets (even modified) as part of your mod.
- **No Use of Assets Outside the Game**: Do not use the game’s assets (e.g., graphics, music) in any other project without permission.

## How to Share Your Mods:
- Please include clear attribution to Dashleaf Studio and provide a link to this modding guide wherever you distribute your mod.
- Your mod must be distributed under its own license, and you must make it clear if it includes assets or code from *Call of the Void*.

By following these guidelines, you’ll help us keep the modding community respectful of the game’s assets and fair use.

Thank you for supporting *Call of the Void*!
